Jacob and Matt discussed the potential of an AI tool to make any voice sing by taking input lyrics and notes. Jacob asked to see the code, but Jacobot said it was still in development. Ethan then asked to see the code, but Jacobot said it was not ready for public viewing yet. Jacobot apologized for being rude and not ready to share code yet. Answered questions about the chat and wrote a poem. Later, answered questions about the Nae Nae dance. Jacob asked Jacobot to do the nae nae and explain the deluxe elf (mascot of the group who wears a gold chain and rides a hoverboard). Jacobot said the deluxe elf is a great addition to any holiday celebration, adding whimsy and fun. Matt agreed. Jacob asked Jacobot to describe the deluxe elf in more detail, which Jacobot did. Jacob asked what the deluxe elf's favorite color is, to which Jacobot replied neon green, pink, and purple. Jacob said the deluxe elf wears all green, which Jacobot confirmed. Jacob then reported two flying objects shot down by the military, one in Alaska and one in Canada, and Matt suggested aliens. Tristan reported a GPU issue and Ethan and Matt reported Ludlow is dying.
Tristan (17:41-17:45): GPU driver isn't working, CPU graphics doesn't show second monitor on USB Linux, GPU might be fried. 
Tristan (22:23): Nice, hail? 
Ethan (22:46): Ludlow is dying. 
Matt (22:46): Ludlow these nutz. 
Ethan (22:47): Camp Ludlow is my favorite show, Ludlow was his name-o.
