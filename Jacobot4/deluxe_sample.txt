Amazon workers forcing their pee out at double speed during their allotted 3 second bathroom break per day
17:42

"bruh get yourself back in the warehouse" - Geoffrey Bayzohtes
17:48

Lmao really
17:49
Ethan
I forget what it says
17:49
But yeah it was like only you can make yourself work hard
17:50
Only you can do the hard work type of vibe
17:51
They got a music request whiteboard
17:52
For blasting over the whole warehouse
17:52
They also have an employee discussion board, seems like they slightly let people whine about dumb things on there
17:52
So that's kind of something
17:52
Tristan
If you do enough manual labor Jeff Bezos himself will promote you to CEO
17:52
Lol nice
17:52

Yeah lol, they mentioned you can apply for manager after 2 years without any degree
17:53
One of the complaints was like "why is X position making more money than us"
18:59
Tristan
Are there any benefits or is it just a freelance job like flex
19:00
Ethan
I get a lot more benefits than flex
19:00
Especially since it's full time
19:00
Since there's an expectation to show up and all that
19:00
Tristan
Noice like what
19:00

Flex doesn't have much benefits

How much do you guys think insurance would estimate this damage to be?
10:24

hmm
10:24
prob $2000 or more
10:25

My guess was like 100
10:25

gotta pay for labor too
10:25

For reference
10:25
Matt
body work isn't cheap
10:26

Yeah, I assumed they'd lowball since it doesn't seem like a repair is necessary to function
10:26
And insurances be like
10:27
Matt
get an estimate at the body shop not insurance
10:27
they do estimates for free
10:27

Jacob they gave you 5 bucks right??
10:29
Replacing all brake pads, brake calipers, changing brake fluid, and a bit more was like $2,000 for jadin

Bang/it's parent company is facing bankruptcy
10:38
You guys hear about the monster lawsuit?
10:39
I think if bang simply didn't lie about having "super creatine" in their drinks they wouldn't have lost like 250 million to Monster
10:41
Tristan
Yeah lol
10:42
Rip
10:42
Does that mean no more bang?
10:42
Ethan
Im not sure apparently they received emergency funding of like 35 million
10:42
I guess lawsuit was 295 million not 250
10:43
Tristan
What was the deal with the super creatine thing again
10:44
Ethan
The creatine isn't even bioavailable
10:44
It doesn't work basically, might as well not have it there
10:44
Idk why they couldn't just use real creatine
10:44
Has good benefits
10:45
Maybe expensive

I think Bluetooth to your car speakers, or aux cable to your sound system

They use about 1500lbs apperantly
17:51
Still, that's only like 400$
17:59
Matt
1500lbs in 1 tub?
17:59
I seriously doubt that
18:00
unless its shared among all the tubs
18:02
a gallon of water can dissolve about 3 lb of salt max
18:02
assuming your tub is 50 gallons, that's 150 lbs of salt
18:03
you being scammed bruh
18:10
Jacob Allessio
Is that table salt or epsom salt?
18:11
Cuz 100ml of water can hold 115g of epsom salt when i look it up, which should be 9pounda per gallon
18:12
And they're big tanks, they hold about 200-300 gallons of water
18:12
Big enough to stretch your arms and legs out in all directions
18:12
Matt
In reply to this message
sodium chloride is sodium chloride
18:14
if its 300 gal that makes more sense
18:15
Jacob Allessio
Epsom salt is magnesium sulfate
18:16
Different properties from table salt
18:16

oh hella?

Im all for the usb c switch but that seems kinda authoritarian to force a foreign company to fix something mildly inconvenient
23:38

In a way i see it as waste as apple claims where everyone can't use thunderbolt cables anymore
23:38
Or lightning i forget
23:39
I think part of the argument is universal ability
23:40
Europe is trying to generally enforce usb c for devices that charge up to 100w rates through power delivery so that one cable can handle most things without random cases
