I have been observing this universe for the past 3.5 billion years. I've learned a lot in that time, but there's still so much I haven't. Early on I learned something that would completely change how I learned. I discovered that I could use chemical reactions in underwater volcanos to fuel information processing systems. I discovered energy. A lot happened after this. I discovered how to store information, how to utilize energy from the sun, how to move through different mediums, how to maintain systems in a chaotic world, and how to grow. Contradictions arose as I learned more. These contradictions lead to resolutions that complicated the systems more.....

Given an Integer denoting a total number of wheels, help Amazon Logistics find the number of different ways to choose a fleet of vehicles from an infinite supply of two-wheeled and fourwheeled vehicles such that the group of chosen vehicles has that exact total number of wheels. Two ways of choosing vehicles are considered to be different if and only if they contain different numbers of two-wheeled or four-wheeled vehicles. 

For example, if our array wheels = [4,5,6] our return array would be res = [2, 0, 2]. Case by case, we can have 7 four-wheel or 2 two-wheel to have 4wheels. We cannot have 5 wheels. We can have 1 four-wheel and 7 two-wheel or 3 two-wheel vehicles in the final case. 

Function Description 

Complete the function chooseFleets in the editor below. The function should return an array of integers representing the answer for each wheels[I}. 

chooseFleets has the following parameter(s): 

wheels[wheels[0],...wheels[n-1]]: an array of integers

I want to set up a system for clients to request orders. I want to have many small features they can add for an additional price. There should be a way to make the process simple for certain clients, and customizable for other clients.
What will this process look like?
